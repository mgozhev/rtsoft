Yet Another Inertial Navigation System

Version: 1.0 2016-07-24

List of directories:
====================
./nav -- userspace calculation program
./drv -- sensor driver
./ref -- reference materials
./pub -- presentation, public speech
./btn -- utility for demonstrtation, *board-specific*

Installation:
=============
Copy mknod.sh to your board.
Edit device tree of your board to add mpu6050 sensor support. 
Look in bcm2708-rpi-b.dts for reference. 

Go to ./drv, add you cross compiler to Makefile.
Run
$ make
Copy fast-mpu6050.ko to /lib/modules/<you kernel release>/extra on your board.

On your board:
Run
$ depmod
Reboot.
After each reboot of your board you should run
$ ./mknod.sh
in order to create /dev/mpu6050 node.

Go to ./nav, add you cross compiler to Makefile.
Run
$ make
Copy nav to your board.

Run
$ make PLATFORM=THIS
This makes host version of nav to calculate trajectory.

How to run program:
===================
see ./nav/README 

Notes:
======
Sensors supported: Ivensense MPU-6050 only.

HW Connection: Sensor is connected to I2C-1 Bus, interrupt line is connected to
GPIO pin. See .dts file.

Sensor settings are hardcoded into driver.
TODO: Export settings to sysfs.

At the moment nav only calculates 2D map. In order to get precise results
the surface of floor must be as level as possible.
